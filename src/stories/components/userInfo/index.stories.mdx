# UserInfo

** Shows information about the user installing a Plan.**

## Overview

The **UserInfo** component is an
[SLDS Card](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/cards/) used to
display information about the User installing a **Plan**.

## States

On a Product page, before a User has logged in, the **UserInfo** component shows
an illustration and text that informs the user that they are not authenticated
with a Salesforce org.

Once a User connects to a Salesforce org, the component shows the user email,
org name, and org type. The header reads "Connected to Salesforce" and a message
explains for how long the user's credentials will be valid.

A message in the footer provides a link to a dropdown menu that gives the User
the ability to log in with a different organization.

Once an installation has started, the component shows fields for the User's
name, organization name, and organization type.

The heading displays a user profile icon and reads "Salesforce Org Information."
