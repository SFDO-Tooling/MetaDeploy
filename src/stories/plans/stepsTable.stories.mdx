# StepsTable
**Shows detailed information about the Steps of an installation.**

## Overview
 The **StepsTable** component is an [SLDS Data Table](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/)
 used to display information about each **Step** involved in
  installing a **Product** or **Plan**.

The table features columns for the name, type, and
install status of each **Step**.

If a pre-install validation check is required, the
**StepsTable** initially only displays columns for
each **Step** name and type.

Once the installation process is able to be started,
an `Install` column appears. If a **Step** is required,
the `Install` column for that **Step** features a checkmark.
If the **Step** is optional, a checkbox that can
be selected is shown.

Once the installation process has begun for a **Step**,
a toggle button appears at the beginning of the **Step** name.
Clicking on the button toggles an expanded list of information
about the time, status, and detailed processes of the **Step**.

When an installation **Step** is complete, a green circle icon with
a white checkmark appears in the `Install` column.

A toggle button for hiding or expanding all logs appears in the `Steps`
column once the first **Step** starts to transmit log data.

If a **Step** fails or is not installed a gray dash is shown in the
`Install` column.
