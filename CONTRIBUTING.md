# Development MetaDeploy

## Using Docker

To set up MetaDeploy using Docker please see the following instructions
[./docs/running_docker.rst](./docs/running_docker.rst).

## Using Local Machine

MetaDeploy can be configured locally. To achieve this follow the instructions
provided in [./docs/running.rst](./docs/running.rst).

## Development Tasks

To run these tests with Docker first run the following commands,

    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec web bash

If you are not using Docker or are using the VS Code integrated terminal inside
the Docker container simply execute the commands in your project's root
directory:

- `yarn serve`: starts development server (with watcher) at
  <http://localhost:8080/> (assets are served from `dist/` dir)
- `yarn test:py`: run Python tests
- `yarn test:py:integration`: run Python integration tests
- `yarn test:js`: run JS tests
- `yarn test:js:watch`: run JS tests with a watcher for development
- `yarn lint`: formats and lints all files
- `yarn lint:js`: formats, lints, and type-checks `.js` files
- `yarn lint:sass`: formats and lints `.scss` files
- `yarn lint:py`: formats and lints `.py` files
- `yarn prettier:js`: formats `.js` files
- `yarn lint:other`: formats `.json`, `.md`, and `.yml` files
- `yarn tsc`: runs JS type-checking
- `yarn build`: builds development (unminified) static assets into `dist/` dir
- `yarn prod`: builds production (minified) static assets into `dist/prod/` dir

## Writing integration tests

For now, our Salesforce integration tests do not modify state on the Salesforce
side; they only test that they _could_. As such, we don't need to generate
scratch orgs to test against.

Instead, we will use some stable testing credentials for a stable test org.

## Internationalization

To build and compile `.mo` and `.po` files for the backend, run:

    $ python manage.py makemessages --locale <locale>
    $ python manage.py compilemessages

These commands require the
[GNU gettext toolset](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
(`brew install gettext`).

For the front-end, translation JSON files are served from `locales/<language>/`
directories, and the
[user language is auto-detected at runtime](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-browser-languageDetector).

During development, strings are parsed automatically from the JS, and an English
translation file is auto-generated to `locales_dev/en/translation.json` on every
build (`yarn build` or `yarn serve`). When this file changes, translations must
be copied over to the `locales/en/translation.json` file in order to have any
effect.

Strings with dynamic content (i.e. known only at runtime) cannot be
automatically parsed, but will log errors while the app is running if they're
missing from the served translation files. To resolve, add the missing key:value
translations to `locales/<language>/translation.json`.

## Storybook Development Workflow

When doing development for the component library in Storybook, use the following
command:

    $ yarn storybook

After running, you can view the Storybook at <http://localhost:6006/> in your
browser.
