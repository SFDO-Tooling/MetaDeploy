# ProgressBar

**Visualizes the progress of an installation Job.**

## Overview

The **ProgressBar** component is an
[SLDS Progress Bar](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/progress-bars/)
used to visually communciate the completion of `Steps` within a `Job`
installation.

The **ProgressBar** appears once an installation has started. The component is
labeled "Installation Progress" and updates the percentage of `Steps` completed.
The completed `Steps` percentage is represented by a colored bar that grows as
the install continues.

The entire bar is filled with a solid green color at completion.

If the installation fails or is canceled, the entire **ProgressBar** turns red
and the respective status is inserted after the "Installation Progress:" label.
