# ProgressIndicator

**Communicates the progress of an installation.**

## Overview

The **ProgressIndicator** component is an
[SLDS Progress Indicator](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicators/)
used to communicate to the user the progress of a `Plan` installation.

The component has two main steps: **"Log In"** (or **"Create Scratch Org"**) and
**"Install."**

## Guidelines

If a user must be logged in to install a plan, **"Log in"** will be the first
step. If it's possible to install the `Plan` into a `Scratch Org`, **"Create
Scratch Org"** will be the first step. If both options are possible, both will
be listed in the first step.

If pre-install validation is required, another step is added before
**"Install"**: **"Run pre-install validation."**

Active steps are empty and marked by a colored border. `Completed` steps are
filled with checkmarks.

`Canceled` or `Failed` steps show an error symbol.

Labels for each step are shown on hover.
